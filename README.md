# Songplaylists
Create a Playlist for songs, with a fixed initial capacity.This store must have the capability to store a list of song-user pairs,  
with each song linked to a user.  It should also be able to fetch recently played songs based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.

# Java Music Playlist Simulation

This Java program simulates a simple music playlist system where users can play songs and view their recently played songs. 
The code defines two classes, `User` and `Song`, to model users and songs and demonstrates their interactions.

## Prerequisites

- You need Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run this program. 
You can download the latest JDK from the official Oracle website or use an alternative like OpenJDK.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to compile and run the Java program:

1. **Create a Java File**: Create a new text file and save it with a ".java" extension.
 You can name it whatever you like; for example, "Secondpgm.java."

2. **Copy the Code**: Copy and paste the provided Java code into the "Secondpgm.java" file you created.

3. **Compile the Code**: Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the "Secondpgm.java" file.
 Compile the Java code using the `javac` command:

**Program Description**
The program simulates a music playlist system with the following key components:

**User Class**: Represents a user with a username and a list of recently played songs (rPS). Users can play songs and retrieve their recently played songs.

**Song Class**: Represents a song with a name and the user who played it.

**Secondpgm Class:** Contains the main method and demonstrates the functionality of the User and Song classes. 
It simulates a user playing songs and displays their recently played songs under different scenarios.

**Usage**
The program demonstrates how to create users, play songs, and retrieve recently played songs.
You can analyze the code and its output to understand how the simulation works.

**Example Output**
The program provides sample output in the console, showing the playlist of recently played songs for the user under various scenarios.
